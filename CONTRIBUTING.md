# Contributing to Game On!

We welcome contributions but request that you follow these guidelines.

## Bugs

Please raise any bug reports on the (respective) project's issue tracker. A search for existing issues is appreciated. 

A good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were trying to do and what went wrong. Also, provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

## New features

Please raise any new feature requests on the project's issue tracker.

## Coding standards

There are a few different projects in the repo, in a few different languages. Most have .editorconfig files. Java projects built with Gradle include changes to eclipse project settings for consistent formatting of Java files.

In general, uses spaces, not tabs. 4 spaces for Java, and 2 spaces for just about everything else. Opening braces should be on the same line, with the closing brace on its own line, unless the block is empty or for else clauses.
