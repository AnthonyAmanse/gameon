# Contributing to Game On!

## Pull requests are always welcome

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

## Create issues...

Any significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before anybody starts working on it.

### ...but check for existing issues first!

Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.

## Coding standards and Conventions

There are a few different projects in the repo, in a few different languages. Most have .editorconfig files. Java projects built with Gradle include changes to eclipse project settings for consistent formatting of Java files.

In general, uses spaces, not tabs. 4 spaces for Java, and 2 spaces for just about everything else. Opening braces should be on the same line, with the closing brace on its own line, unless the block is empty or for else clauses.

a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This clarifies the intellectual 
property license granted with any contribution. It is for your protection as a

slightly different.
